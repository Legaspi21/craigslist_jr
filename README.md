# Craigslist Jr

This is a very simple rendition of Craigslist I built to practice Ruby on Rails.

Things I learned/experimented with:

* How to set up Postgresql as the DB on app creation

* Nested resources

* Configuration

* User authentication with Devise

* User permissions

* Database initialization
